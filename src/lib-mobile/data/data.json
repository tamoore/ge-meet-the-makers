      "body": "<p>When she’s in her pretty-as-a-picture home port of Hobart, the research vessel <a href=\"http://csirofrvblog.com/\">Investigator</a>, with her bright blue, white and green livery, makes for a pleasing juxtaposition of old mariners and cutting-edge marine science, her three giant radar bulbs silhouetted against the sky, high above the rigging of tall ships berthed nearby in Constitution Dock. It’s an impressive sight, and one that was a long time coming. The Marine National Facility’s $120m Investigator is the result of years of careful planning, which began in 2005 and enlisted a steering committee of leading Australian scientists to decide exactly what research capabilities she should have. Construction in the Singapore shipyard of Teekay (the successful tender for the project) began in 2012; Investigator arrived in Hobart to much celebration in September 2014, and her maiden voyage to begin testing her vast collection of scientific equipment was in March 2015.</p><p>Capable of travelling 10,000 nautical miles in a voyage with up to 40 scientists and support staff, the 93.9m ship will sail from the equator to the Antarctic ice-edge, carrying leading Australian scientists, who must <a href=\"http://www.mnf.csiro.au/Applying-for-sea-time.aspx\"><u>apply for sea time</u></a> to show why their research is deserving of time aboard the nation’s only blue-water research vessel. The voyage schedule is planned out two years in advance, with applications for sea time internationally peer reviewed and assessed for both the quality of the science and the potential contribution of that research to the national interest. </p><p>It’s not hard to understand why Dr Tara Martin was lured home to Australia from her beloved job at the British Antarctic Survey to join the CSIRO and set up the team supporting the vessel’s geophysical science research capabilities. “My particular domain on-board Investigator is the marine acoustics,” she explains of the suite of equipment mostly suspended about 1.2m beneath the ship’s hull in a gondola “shaped a bit like a space shuttle”. Investigator is rated DNV Silent-R, meaning “we emit very little noise into the environment,” says Martin, adding that there’s a lot of international interest in the MNF’s new vessel. “The acoustics suite is almost unparalleled … to my knowledge there are only about seven other ships in the world with a suite quite as expansive as the one we have.” Being one of the quietest vessels afloat also gives Investigator maximum ability to monitor the marine ecosystem: “If we come across a school of fish we can sneak up on them and do a surprise attack!” jokes Martin. It also helps in mapping the seafloor, because being “very acoustically quiet maximises the return that comes back” from the two multibeam echo sounders. Being suspended beneath the hull further isolates them from the ship’s vibrations and aids the collection of high-quality data.</p><p>Investigator is now hard at work taking scientists on voyages for geoscience, atmospheric, oceanographic and biological research. Among the many scientific goals are collecting data to assist communities to prepare for extreme weather events, improve our understanding of fish stocks and breeding grounds to promote sustainable fishing, and to continue mapping the seafloor of Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone — with more than 10 million sq km of marine jurisdiction, only 12% has been mapped to date. “It took us 12 years to map about 12%,” says Martin. “They were some of the easy bits! I’d say we’ve got at least 30, 40, 50 years’ more work to do. And even then, once it’s done, if newer technology comes along we might be able to do it better. Some of the soundings we use on our nautical charts are well over 200 years old. If we acquire the dataset right in the first place, people could still be using this data that we’re acquiring in 200 years.”</p>",

The controls are exactly the same as space engineers would use. It only took a group of video game designers sitting in one room to watch the magic happen.”</p><p>The software is aimed at reducing satellite downtime and streamlining operations for an overall cost saving.</p><p>Part of the challenge of solving hi-tech problems in space is the communication lapse between ground control and the ISS or any of the number of spacecraft and satellites orbiting the Earth.</p><p>“Making a corrective action to a spacecraft is a big problem,” Held says. “Mars for example is a 20-minute one-way communication link. So if the astronaut radios down to Houston to say ‘we have a problem’, it can take 20 minutes for that message to reach Earth and another 20 minutes to send the solution back up to the craft.</p><p>“Every minute the satellite is affected, the downstream customer is losing millions of dollars, not to mention Tom Hanks will be dead by then. We have developed a series of AI that takes data streams from satellites, compares it to other data streams and figures out the exact root cause of the problem and fixes it.”</p><p>PIGI lets you troubleshoot anything mechanical in space: the ISS, a satellite, or the very spacecraft you are travelling in. You can take it apart and analyse it piece-by-piece virtually on-screen as if it were LEGO, and then identify exactly where the problem is located using colour grading (red equals bad, green equals good).</p><p>Watching Held at his corner desk as he takes apart a virtual version of the ISS with the swipe of a finger, it really does feel like he is playing God, and there are any number of commercial applications PIGI could be used for, he says.</p><p>“This software could be used for modelling defects on the Mars Rover. It could track it in its high state environment, identify all of those problems, track them and mould them.</p><p>“We could use PIGI to track people walking around Mars in space suits, track their heart rate and even their skin temperature.</p><p>“You might actually be able to model their heart rate based on the rovers they were examining, and we will be able to say what’s going on there. It’s pretty full on.”</p>",

For one, the longer you stay in space the more your sense of smell diminishes, along with your ability to taste different flavours properly.</p><p>Tara Croft is a former Saber employee who volunteered to test the beer in zero-G to discover whether male and female space travellers reacted differently to the concoction.</p><p>“When you’re on the Earth, gravity pulls all liquid down in your body,” Croft says. “In zero-G that’s not happening, so your sinuses fill up with mucus and your sense of smell and taste is therefore reduced.”</p><p>To combat this, Saber has used the robust beer style of stout to keep up the flavour.</p><p>Another hazard to compensate for is the carbonation. Burping in space, at least when it comes to carbonated beverages, isn’t so much a burp as a regurgitation.</p><p>“In zero-G, the way carbonated liquid works is that you have fat bubbles that sit still in liquid, they don’t rise to the surface so it means you’re drinking gas bubbles as well,” Croft says.</p><p>“It leads to this unfortunate phenomenon called the ‘wet burp’. The gas is in the liquid bowl in your stomach, and you wet burp. That’s a big problem for carbonated beverages, such as beer.</p><p>“Flat beer is revolting. So we had to carbonate it enough that it tasted good but not so much you were unsafe.”</p><p>And of course swigging in space is itself a challenge, with the beer going everywhere in zero-G.</p><p>To combat this, Saber has developed a wick which allows users to consume the drink straight from the bottle as you would on Earth rather than through a specially-designed space squeeze tube.</p><p>The insert uses capillary action so that the beer can wick along the tight, angled crevices and into the mouth of the consumer.</p><p>The company is in the process of designing a space beer bottle, which might in time make the wick redundant. But it’s a super top-secret project which Held is not yet ready to release.</p>",

That’s one reason GE’s sensor-enabled jet engines that report on their own health are key to Virgin Australia’s smooth-running operations.</p><p>“For on-time performance, engine technology is extremely important,” Andrew Lillyman, general manager network operations for the airline, says. “We want to get the data relating to the performance of the aircraft, and analyse it so that our engineers can use that in improving performance.” </p><p>The more aircraft that are ready to fly, the more agile the airline can be in responding to schedule requirements and to disruptions. “It gives us options in the Operations Control Centre, so that if we do have a delay we can swap aircraft and keep our guests flying to their destination on time,” Lillyman says.</p><p>Although the frame of an aircraft is attended to on a car-like maintenance schedule — changing tyres, checking oils, topping up hydraulic fluid and doing diagnostics according to the kilometres flown—GE’s 90-115 and CFM 567 engines report on their own needs. </p><p>And these days that’s rarely a cry for help or a call to the emergency hangar. Tens of sensors constantly monitor the engine’s vital signs, including temperature and pressure readings. Other sensors report on wear and tear, on the smallest change in performance, well in advance of breakdown, allowing maintenance to be scheduled at times convenient to the flying customers. That’s usually at night, when the bulk of flying is over for the day.</p><p>Interestingly, just as flight disruption can be avoided by simply swapping out an aircraft that needs unplanned maintenance during the day, an engine that has checked itself in for diagnosis and perhaps surgery will also simply be swapped with a recently serviced engine. There’s no need to keep a good frame down.</p><p>At Virgin Australia, almost its entire mainline fleet of some 105 Boeing aircraft, and the Brazilian-manufactured Embraers, are powered by GE engines. To assist with analysis and interpretation of engine-generated data, and to advise on appropriate predictive maintenance, two GE engineers, experts in engine technical support, are full-time on the Virgin team, with a hotline to GE jet-engine headquarters in Cincinnati in the US.</p><p>Similarly, a team of Virgin maintenance engineers are embedded for liaison in Lillyman’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) team, to interpret the likely disruption caused by aircraft service requirements. </p><p>In this way, innovative engine design is enabling people to make better collaborative decisions for the safety and satisfaction of the flying public.</p>",

The team continually strives for OTP improvement and every flight counts. A weather event such as fog in a major capital can significantly impact the network, with each delayed flight potentially causing further disruptions to the schedules of those following. </p><p>When there are disruptions, Virgin Australia’s general manager network operations Andrew Lillyman says social media and digital communications are channels that can most nimbly respond and communicate to passengers. They can help shift customer satisfaction when every other herculean effort fails.</p><p>“We’ve halved disruptions over the past year,” Lillyman says. “But for those who are disrupted through delays, diversions or cancellations, it’s essential to us to ensure our customers’ experience is the best possible, so that they still walk away feeling like they’ve been looked after, treated well and we’ve respected their time.”</p><p>Digital communication is the main avenue for disseminating changes of schedule directly to the day’s customers. It sure beats arriving at the airport and staring at a list of departures only to find your flight has been cancelled. “Now you receive SMS and emails to ensure you can plan your day better if there’s a delay or cancellation,” says Lillyman.</p><p>But, he adds, it is social media technology that is one of the greatest change agents influencing the industry today.</p><p>Virgin Australia has nearly a million followers on social media. Four social media agents work from 5am to 11pm to keep up the communications from the OCC to answer every message.</p><p>Twitter and Facebook are used in the event of major disruptions, such as cyclonic winds, but otherwise serve to communicate news and marketing messages. Any changes in Virgin’s cabins, lounges, Velocity frequent flyer program and destinations (“now flying to Tamworth”) are delivered via social media.</p><p>“As an industry we’re embracing social media and focussing on how it then interacts with other technologies in the marketplace,” Lillyman says. “For example, Google Flight Stats, TripAdvisor and other third-party applications that we might not necessarily control.</p><p>“For the guests, we have to ensure that we get a consistent message out there, no matter what the channel.”</p><p>Although it sounds simple, the use of social media and digital platforms for alerting passengers to schedule changes has required significant change management in an organisation so finely-tuned to on-time performance. </p><p>“In order to send an SMS or email that alerts our customers to a disruption, our operations controllers have to commit to a delay,” explains Lillyman. “That means they have to stop trying to restore on-time performance for that flight. We had to overcome the concern of the operations controllers. It’s something they weigh up and take very seriously. </p><p>“It’s about achieving the best trade-off between maximising on-time performance but ensuring the guests are communicated with and have certainty about their travel plans.”</p>",

Depending on the piece of music, and where you are in the piece, the leadership shifts.”</p><p>Back at home in Brisbane, Lillyman runs Virgin Australia’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) where he is responsible for keeping the airline’s flights running safely to schedule.</p><p>He looks for innovation as applied by colleagues within the industry as well as in what other sectors may be doing with their own team members and technology.</p><p>For a planned refurbishment of the OCC for instance, Lillyman looked to an operator in the gas industry who was happy to share vital knowledge of what they had learned during a similar upgrade. “They talked about where they could have done better. That’s priceless information that’s going to save you time and money,” he says, adding that: “In the operational space, and across industries, there’s definitely the desire to help.”</p><p>Virgin’s frequent buyer status with GE recently led Lillyman to attend the GE Leadership University in upstate New York: “It’s a campus an hour north of New York. It was a farm that GE bought in 1952 and they’ve developed it so that it feels like a university, in that it has auditoriums, 200 rooms on site, eating facilities.” </p><p>With some 150 other participating GE customers from around 25 different countries, Lillyman spent four days attending sessions that approached leadership from different perspectives.</p><p>He says he was impressed by GE’s focus on “simplicity in leadership” as stressed by CEO and chairman Jeff Immelt. “Doing simple things well, in order to create a positive climate for innovation, that’s something I brought back,” Lillyman says. </p><p>“To me leadership is more circular than the traditional top down. I’ve got something to contribute and I know all the other team members do too.</p><p>“I don’t hold all the answers, don’t have all the skill sets. So I can contribute by setting a path and unblocking barriers for team members, but they will bring other technical capabilities or approaches.”</p><p>Lillyman says both Virgin and GE have recently overhauled their performance-management practices, and independently adopted similar procedures to foster regular discussion. </p><p>“It’s interesting the feedback from one of our OCC team members yesterday was that what they’re enjoying is the clarity around what’s expected of them, what they’re supposed to do on a day-to-day basis, and how that helps the company.”</p><p>But on a morning when the fog has just lifted from the Brisbane tarmac, and every cog in the Virgin machine is striving to keep it running on time, Lillyman reiterates that the thrill in his work is in satisfying more than 20 million guests a year.</p>",

Unsurprisingly, CSIRO’s Dr Tara Martin has a much deeper thought process as she crosses Australia’s vast ocean territories aboard the Marine National Facility’s super-charged science vessel, the RV Investigator, working to “build up a bathymetric map of the Australian marine environment”. </p><p>Bathymetry is the underwater equivalent of topography — the under-the-sea world is a mass of fascinating subsea ranges, many either uncharted or added to hydrographic maps many decades ago with information gathered manually, using plumb lines. (Bad luck for a ship with a deep draft using old charts if the plumb line was dropped in one spot where a seamount lies 200m below sea level, but only a little further over rises to only 20m below!)</p><p>The detail being captured via Investigator’s multibeam echo sounder systems is opening up a whole new world, complete with amazing 3D imagery that brings the seascape alive for scientists and laypeople alike. Martin, marvelling at her powerful new equipment, tells of experimenting with some of the images captured from the deep oceans, just to see what detail she could zoom into. “I thought, ‘I wonder how good we can get the deep-water system in, say, 2,000 metres of water’,” Martin recalls. “I pulled out some transit data that we took recently in the Southern Ocean and I found a feature which was a seamount, in about 1,800 metres of water.” She zoomed in “finer and finer and finer … I got it down to five metres”. At that point, the swath width — the areas of beams being projected from the multibeam system — was 8km wide. “We’re surveying 8 kilometres ... and I can resolve it to 25 metres! The only reason I couldn’t resolve something finer was it was the smallest thing I could find. In 2,000 metres of water, we could easily resolve something that’s 10 metres. In terms of resolution, these are a whole step change further ahead.”</p><p>The geoscience research that will be conducted by scientists from Investigator will not only look at the seafloor, but beneath it. The sonar technology housed in the ship’s gondola sends acoustic signals up to 30km wide in water to depths of 11.5km, sending back data that builds 3D images of the sea floor’s canyons and mountains. “We’ll use the bathymetry systems to have a look at the shape and type of the seafloor. We measure how much of that information comes back. We call that backscatter. The sonar as it goes down is diffracted and bounces off into the environment; not all of it comes back. We measure how much comes back, and that gives us an idea of how hard or soft, and how rough or smooth the seafloor is. That means we can differentiate things like mud from sand, or sand from rock, and how rough that might be. And that’s important according to the type of equipment you want to sample that with. We also have a sub-bottom profiler, which gives us an idea of what kind of sediments we’re looking into.”</p>",

      "body": "<p>Until the Investigator, Australian researchers did not have the capability to assess our fisheries below 1,500m. The advanced fish-school assessment sonar technology fitted to the new vessel enables scientists to collect data on marine life up to 3,000m below the ocean’s surface. A towed-camera system can descend to 6,000m and feed real-time observation back to the scientists onboard. And the ship’s physical sampling equipment — from fine-gauge surface nets to seafloor coring equipment — can collect samples from near the surface, all the way down to 5,000m below it, and 50cm <em>beneath</em> the sea floor. The Investigator set-up is a marine biologist’s dream.</p><p>“In addition to the multibeam sonars, Investigator also has two different types of bioacoustic equipment,” explains Dr Tara Martin. “The split-beam multi-frequency bioacoustic echo sounder is a single-beam sonar which looks through the water column rather than at the seafloor. It uses six different frequencies, because different frequencies have different wavelengths, and these wavelengths have different resolving sizes. One of the things we’re looking for is gas bubbles in the water column. It can be gas bubbles that are, say, methanes coming up from the sea floor, but it can also be the swim bladder of a fish, or a piece of plankton, something that’s causing a density difference in the water column. Scientists use that to actually measure productivity — what kind of biomass, what kind of fish, what kind of plankton there are on the seafloor.”</p><p>Martin stresses that bioacoustics is not her area of scientific expertise, but as she heads up the group charged with supporting Investigator’s science acquisition and data processing, she certainly knows the equipment, and deftly operates the sonar systems that her bioacoustician colleagues are using to study the water column. As the sonars feed back their data, Martin is constantly checking to ensure it’s all working correctly. She shows a series of images with recent bioacoustics data, displayed on four of the 24 monitors in her operations room. “The bioacousticians combine these frequencies and gain an estimate of what kind of species they might be looking in the water column, and how many there are over a various area,” she says. “They will use this to look at the size and health of various types of fish species that are in a particular area, and that then feeds through into fisheries habitat management. If you understand how many fish there are in an area, whether they’re improving or declining, that can actually help feed how you manage fish stocks, for example.”</p><p>Marine biologists working from Investigator will be studying everything from phytoplankton, sea sponges and worms to species important to the nation’s fishing industry, such as the southern bluefin tuna. Combining the study of the biomass in the water columns with the seafloor mapping goes to a deeper understanding of our ocean’s ecosystems.  “On top of the single-beam fisheries acoustic system, we also have a multibeam version of that. That runs over a slightly narrower band of frequencies, but that means we can actually come up with real-time three dimensional estimates of biomass — schools of fish — and how big they are. And having a 3D picture of that is an incredibly powerful tool.”</p><p>Martin regards her latest dataset enthusiastically. “It’s absolutely fascinating watching this, particularly at dawn and dusk … we can actually watch the migration of plankton up to the surface of the water and back down again with these systems,” she says. Her bioacoustician colleagues, she adds, “have some really very cool technology which allows them to actually come up with an idea of what species they’re looking at.” For a closer look, they’ll send down the towed cameras to check out the biomass in real time. Talk about a live feed.</p>",

In Australia, the regulatory body is the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), in the US, it’s the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p><p>“One of the first milestones is to show that the genetic elements that we’re using actually work. We did that early on in cells in tissue culture outside the body,” says Symonds. </p><p>“We then showed that the therapy was safe in animal models, that it wasn’t toxic.” For Symonds this was one of the most exciting phases of his many years in HIV research: the trials showed that not only was the therapy harmless to mice, but that it was effective in HIV-infected rodents, and effective in monkeys, in primates, “and therefore that it could be effective in humans as well”.</p><p>Calimmune also had to develop the vector that delivers the genes into the cells. Some of the most important collaborations Symonds helped manage on behalf of Calimmune were in identifying the right vector system. In this case, he explains, the vector “is a modified virus that carries the genes into the cells—it’s modified in such a way that it’s harmless to humans”. </p><p>The next major step for Calimmune is to secure approval to begin phase one safety and feasibility testing in humans. “The TGA in Australia and the FDA in the US say ‘yes, we accept that you’ve shown there’s a reasonable chance that this therapy will work’ and they let us move into clinical trials,” says Symonds.</p><p>Calimmune in Australia will begin human clinical trials later this year. In the US, the company has already begun the first phase, which it arranged into testing of three cohorts of patients to help establish a cell-delivery procedure.</p><p>“When we see the results of this trial, we’ll move to a phase two clinical trial in humans, which will be more around efficacy,” says Symonds. “Then phase three tests for efficacy relative to other agents, and then you get approval.”</p><p>Symonds won’t hazard a guess at when market day will be. The trials will take the time they take, and they will progress depending on the results at each stage.</p>",

Sounds simple?</p><p>Gene therapy company Calimmune, with research teams in the US and in Australia, has been developing this deceptively straightforward-sounding treatment to reverse the progression of HIV in individual patients. But behind the scenes, hi-tech laboratory equipment is helping to enable the gradual translation of experimental work into commercial application, says Dr Geoff Symonds, Calimmune’s head of scientific affairs and collaborations.</p><p>Take the clean room. It’s a specialised environment sealed against particles, pathogens, anything that might interfere with the quality of the gene-modified cells. Because those are someone’s cells you’re working on, with the intention of returning them, you need to be especially sure that no cross-contamination can occur. </p><p>A clean room is expensive to maintain, but Calimmune has been funded to use the hyper-hygienic facility at the Kids Research Institute at Westmead Children’s Hospital in Sydney for its work. “The Research Infrastructure Support Grant funded us to start the work within the clean room, with Professor Ian Alexander advising and with Mark Ornatowski as the facilities manager,” says Symonds. </p><p>In the clean room, air is circulated through fine filters with pores of 20 microns, to trap as many particles as possible. And the air is pressurised to exert outward force when the sealed door is opened, blowing back the wall of particles poised to enter. Cleanliness is also maintained by periodic washdowns of the room’s surfaces with biocides that eliminate and prevent growth of moulds and spores.</p><p>Because no effort to exclude particles from a laboratory may be 100% successful, the immediate environment of procedures carried out in the clean room is also monitored. That is, particles in the air around a clinical procedure are allowed to settle onto a surface. The surface is then tested for microbes so that a reading of the microbes that existed around each procedure can be recorded, which verifies sterility.</p><p>Cell biologists from Symonds’ Darlinghurst-based team enter the clean room through the progressively pressurised anterooms, putting on sterile gear as they go. They are only allowed to touch the insides of the lab outfits as they dress, to prevent contamination by their skin of the outer, lab-facing fabric.</p><p>Wearing sterile double scrubs (jumpsuit and gown), hoods, booties, gaiters, two pairs of gloves and masks, they work with a number of specialised machines that allow them to process large quantities of cells.</p><p>The cell separator, for example, allows faster and more efficient separation of greater numbers of cells than would be possible using manual techniques. Similarly, a washing machine, or rather, a cell-washing machine, prepares the cellular materials for processing and frees a scientist for other tasks.</p><p>Expanding each patient’s modified cells—growing enough cells to have a potential therapeutic effect when reintroduced to the body—is a crucial part of the laboratory procedure.</p><p>This task is handled by the GE Xuri, a device which looks like little more than a bag of blood sloshing interminably backwards and forwards on a seesawing platform. In fact, this unassuming-looking machine is constantly filtering out waste and aerating the cells. The wave-like motion caused by the rocking platform stops cells from clumping, which can inhibit multiplication.</p><p>“If you don’t use a machine like the Xuri, you have to use lots of flasks,” Symonds says. “You have to frequently change the medium, and in smaller containers you couldn’t grow up the same density of cells.”</p><p>The most innovative parts of Calimmune’s work are its proprietary technologies, such as the processes of putting genes into cells to protect those cells from HIV. These are the most significant procedures, but they can more easily be scaled from experimental to clinically applicable with the help of specialised laboratory equipment.</p>",

The vast majority of people inherit two normal copies (one from each parent) of a gene producing CCR5, the primary co-receptor used by HIV to infect cells. 1% however receive two mutant genes that don’t produce CCR5. It is this mutation that Calimmune has mimicked and artificially introduced to HIV/AIDS patients’ cells to potentially repopulate their bodies with protected cells that replace the HIV-infected cells.</p><p>The concept of producing a population of protected cells was first elaborated by Nobel Laureate Dr David Baltimore, who is chairman of the board of directors of Calimmune.</p><p>Science is a process of building on past breakthroughs, and part of Dr Geoff Symonds’ role as Calimmune’s head of scientific affairs and collaborations is to accelerate that process for the company. </p><p>To this end he not only contributes scientific papers for peer scrutiny but frequently travels to attend scientific meetings, is an active member of various research hubs, and presents Calimmune’s work at conferences. “Speaking at conferences is very important because it invites feedback and constructive critique, that could lead to improvements in Calimmune’s technology or technique,” Symonds says.</p><p>“The notion of biology at the moment is that it’s very broad,” he says, and to be an expert in all the fields of endeavour that impact on Calimmune’s work would be impossible. “You need to work with people who are subject matter experts in different fields.” </p><p>Symonds recently traveled to New Orleans to a meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy where he was able to discuss clinical advancements with other researchers.</p><p>“Being active within these societies means we are able to see what is happening in the world of science. We’re all moving in a similar direction, and technology that is applied to one disease can be applied to a different disease,” he says.</p><p>Symonds also frequently travels to Los Angeles, to talk with the Calimmune group there and with his collaborators at UCLA, to make sure that work is on track. He says: “Nothing, nothing matches the ability to meet with people face-to-face and to understand exactly where the process is at, and to communicate where you want to get to.”</p><p>Calimmune’s therapy as it stands requires each patient’s cells to be worked on individually in the laboratory and Symonds says that this could be a limiting factor in the widespread application of the treatment. “But like all things in science, if it works, then the means to make it more available, and to do it more efficiently, will be found.” </p><p>He is of course already talking, communicating with colleagues, planting the seeds, asking questions and seeking innovative answers to make that happen.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There’s welding action in one part of the workshop, two-way radio chatter in another and a series of ding-ding-dings and expressive zhooooshes from the giant locomotives shunting back and forth, but it’s generally a quiet day at the vast shed that is Roy Hill’s main maintenance and provisioning workshop for its railway, a system so new that the tracks are still being tamped down.</p><p>This relative stillness will be a tranquil memory come September, as Roy Hill’s separate moving parts — iron-ore mining and processing, and rail, port and remote operations — come together as one painstakingly planned, integrated operation to export 55 million tonnes of iron ore each year from Port Hedland via ship. </p><p>The shiny newness of all the buildings and equipment will soon take on a new hue as the Pilbara’s famous red dirt takes over, but it’s clear that Bruce Brymer, manager of maintenance for Roy Hill’s rolling stock, will do his all to keep his fleet as pristine as possible. Says Brymer: “I’ve got responsibility for maintaining the locomotive fleet, the rail-car fleet — which includes the ore cars and the fuel cars — the ballast cars, flat cars and all the ancillary vehicles. We've got responsibility for maintaining the track machines and also all the facilities, the buildings, are all ours to look after.” </p><p>Technology will be a key collaborator for Brymer as he sends the GE Evolution ES44ACi locomotives into service on the tracks. Locotrol technology has been part of GE’s suite of locomotive offerings for some 30 years — which is as long as Brymer has been working in rail. The Loctorol XA (for eXtended Architecture) that’s been built-into Roy Hill’s locos is the latest generation, and will help out Brymer and his maintenance crew and Roy Hill’s drivers in several ways.</p><p>Locotrol Distributed Power reduces wear and tear on the locomotives and the tracks, explains Brymer, by reducing what’s known as “in-train forces”, essentially, the steel-on-steel grind of the wheels on the rail that inevitably wears on both. “With trains that are 2.6 kilometres long, force moves up and down the train a bit like a xylophone,” says Brymer. “There are continuous waveforms flowing up and down the train, depending on where the mass is moving to. If it’s going up a hill, then it’s moving backwards; if it’s going down the hill it’s moving forwards. And then it reverberates back through the train.”</p><p>Distributed Power allows the driver to individually control multiple sets of locomotives in the same train at the same time. “It is a major way of reducing the in-train forces,” explains Brymer. In the Roy Hill set-up, two locomotives will be at the front of the train, followed by 116 ore cars and then a second locomotive, with another 116 ore cars behind it. For the first 30km out of the mine (up an imperceptible grade, but steep when you’re hauling a 31,132-tonne load), two banker locomotives will push from behind, and then drop away, leaving the train to make the journey to port. “Distributed Power allows for a mid-train locomotive to help control the in-train forces along the route.”</p><p>This latest Locotrol set-up for Roy Hill boasts Dual-Mode Distributed Power, which provides two modes of communication along the train, the traditional radio-frequency communication (which will still be used at certain points in the train’s operation), and the more reliable “down-the-wire” communication — a physical cable that runs down the pipe for the train’s electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) braking system. “The challenge with radio frequency on long trains has always been that, especially in hilly or curvy territory, you can lose communication between the lead loco and the mid-train loco. And that was OK, because as long as you had your train line intact, the mid-train locomotive would continue to operate on its most recent setting. But with the down-the-wire control, it is rock solid, the communication link is absolutely secure; there’s no risk.” This system enables constant communication to adjust the power as required, improving fuel efficiency and wear on the tracks. “Fuel is one of the major operating costs of any railroad,” says Brymer, “and these locomotives are the most fuel-efficient locomotives in the market.”</p><p>The other major cost for a railway, Brymer adds, is “rail replacement on track, and wheel replacement on the rolling stock”. Distributed Power helps on that score, and the Roy Hill railroad itself has also been carefully mapped out to be as easy on the rolling stock as possible. “As a heavy-haul railway we try and get it as flat and as straight as we possibly can,” he says. </p><p>Efficiency was one aim of the new railway; respecting cultural heritage was another. The railway traverses the territory of three traditional owner groups — the Kariyarra, the Palyku and the Nyiyaparli people — and one of Roy Hill’s heritage officers has walked the 344km track several times with elders, in several cases directing that the railway route be diverted to avoid an area of cultural significance. That’s well-distributed power of a different sort.</p>",

It’s also going to be a game-changer for Roy Hill rolling-stock maintenance manager Bruce Brymer and his crew.</p><p>Via a system of 250 sensors on each of the iron-ore mine’s locos, and nine WiMAX super Wi-Fi hotspots along the 344km of tracks they travel, each locomotive will self-report on thousands of details of its individual welfare. Says Brymer: “When the locomotive computer senses an out-of-course trend — a trend that isn’t a healthy trend — it’ll start taking that data and put it into a packet of information and transmit it back to Erie in the United States.”</p><p>There, at GE’s purpose-built EOA centre in Pennsylvania, the data will be analysed and diagnosed in an operation that is a neat illustration of the company’s global push across many industries and technologies for what it calls the <a href=\"https://www.gesoftware.com/industrial-internet\"><u>Industrial Internet</u></a>. </p><p>“The computers will do the analysis, they’ll identify what is most likely to be the problem,” Brymer says. “A GE technician will go over the answer and verify that it is a good advice, and then that will come back via an email to Roy Hill, and our people will review that. They’ll make a decision about when the locomotive can be brought in, and we’ll have a list of actions that we need to take to be able to attend to that locomotive straight away, as soon as it arrives back at the workshop.” Farewell to the days when a driver reported a weird clunk that couldn’t be replicated in the workshop, or even back on the track (sound familiar, car drivers?). No more crawling over an engine to find which oil pump is playing up.</p><p>, which GE shorthands to Rx, from a technician it gives the title of GE Power Doctor. Yes, they’re writing a prescription for your sick loco.  “The target time once it goes through all the computer programs back at Erie, is to have that Rx transmission back to us in 20 minutes,” says Brymer. “So it’s really live, happening right there and then.”</p><p>“Expert on Alert is such a great system,” Brymer continues. “We really do know what condition the fleet is in … It gives us a level of confidence that things are running well. It cuts down all the troubleshooting and effectively reduces the time that it takes to identify a defect on a locomotive when it comes back to the depot. We’re on that locomotive, fixing it straight away, as soon as it gets back. We’ll turn that locomotive back around and get it back into operation much more quickly than we would have done in the past.”</p><p>The Rx recommendations will also classify the defects into severity: red (failed or will fail soon), yellow (may fail within seven days), white (defect can wait until next regular maintenance) and blue (general remote monitoring and diagnostic equipment report). Repair times are also estimated, with advice on whether the fix can be done on the train, on the track or needs to be brought into the workshop. Detailed final feedback on the result of the diagnostics and subsequent repairs will ensure EOA becomes a continuous learning system for both GE and Roy Hill.</p><p>The real-time data from the locos is also available for Brymer and his crew to check on the internet, even when nothing is amiss. The locos will let their masters know precisely where they are on the track, their speed, the weather — and more. Roy Hill’s locomotives are also ready to be upgraded for future releases of the EOA remote flying loco doctor service, where even more detailed, specialist prognostics will be possible. </p><p>An automobile owner watching his or her mysteriously grinding car going back up on the hoist for another expensive exploratory session with the mechanic can only dream of the day when this kind of smart self-diagnosis will be available for their machines.</p>",

      "body": "<p>At Roy Hill’s Remote Operations Centre near Perth airport, a bank of CCTV screens is showing scenes such as gargantuan diggers scooping up mounds of iron ore and depositing them into marginally smaller dump trucks. The visuals represent a fraction of the operations that will be tracked and scrutinised in real time — along with the data being fed into the system from continuous monitoring — once the iron-ore project is fully operational and in export mode by September 2015. </p><p>The Remote Operations Centre, known as the ROC, is about 1300km from the mine itself, and some 1600km from Port Hedland, home to the mine’s rail and port operations. The ROC, which opened in November 2013, is the nerve centre for Roy Hill. An observation deck from the administration offices overlooks the vast control room, dozens of computer screens showing the key data along the highly organised demand-chain, arranged right-to-left in chronological order of the mine’s operations: mining, processing, rail and port. </p><p>“The loading of trains, movement of trains and unloading of trains are components within the demand chain system,” explains Ian Murfit, manager of the demand chain, a tightly integrated set-up that is one of the new mine’s points of difference, compared with mines dealing with silo-ed divisions and legacy systems tied to bygone technology and practices. “The load-out facility at the processing plant will load five trains per day, 365 days per year,” continues Murfit. “A train controller located at the ROC will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the train load-out facility.”</p><p>He’s talking about Tower Control, a feature of GE’s Locotrol system that’s integrated with the company’s locomotives. At the mine, when the trains are being loaded with ore — a process that takes about 160 minutes a train — the train driver hands control over from Pilbara to Perth. There are, of course, a host of safety and communications checks and rechecks, but once they’re all done, a driverless train is ready to be loaded.</p><p>“The train driver steps off and acknowledges to the ROC that he’s clear of the train, and then the ROC takes control of the train,” says Roy Hill’s rolling-stock maintenance manager Bruce Brymer. “That’s when Tower Control comes in; the ROC train load-out people proceed to load the train. They set a target speed, and there are a number of sensors and controls based on the density of the iron ore, and the volume required to give it the target weight in each ore car. The car loads, and then moves across a weighbridge to validate the load is hitting the target weight. Any adjustments that are required are controlled back through the train load-out at the ROC. It’s a very accurate weighing system for loading.”</p><p>Throughout the process, the Tower Control remote operators monitor and control the train’s traction, air brake, alarms and other functions, affording precise speed control of the driverless train. It’s faster for the ROC controllers to stop it should there be an issue than it would be with voice-issued commands, for example. Once loaded, a driver boards the train and takes it back down to Port Hedland. At the rail yard, 8km shy of the port, says Brymer: “We break the train into two halves, and send them down to the port to unload it in two portions. We’ve got about 90 minutes to do any maintenance activities that we need to do — refuel, check the oil, check the coolant, re-sand — and then we make the train up when the second half of the train comes back and it heads back to the mine.” </p><p>Drivers have another Locotrol feature they can access if they have an issue with an ore car while out on the 344km track: <a href=\"http://www.getransportation.com/its/train-optimization/train-consist-efficiency-solutions/locotrol-remote-controlled-locomotive-rcl\"><u>Remote Controlled Locomotive</u></a>. Brymer explains: “If they get a defect notification on an ore car mid-journey, the driver can step off the train and take control of the train via his Remote Control belt pack.” This enables the driver to move the train forward, remove the bad ore car from the train and back it into a “bad-order siding”, recouple the train, hop back into the locomotive and continue the journey. “He can do this with no assistance, and without having to walk down the train, or along the track,” says Brymer. “It reduces the risks of the driver being hurt by walking around the track … and when you’re in the Pilbara and it’s 45, 50 degrees, that is going to be a great feature. It is a very nice piece of the kit for the drivers.”</p>",

      "body": "<p>The engineer and former US Army major runs Saber from his mission control in Sydney’s inner-city Chippendale, offering a suite of key space technology innovations and services to the world.</p><p>“Our fundamental goal is reducing cost of entry to space,” Held says. “Saber Astronautics’ mission is to make spaceflight available to everyone. That has a very human element to it.”</p><p>Held and his team have created their Responsive Space Operations Centre (RSOC) here to leverage advances in AI and streamline the operations of satellites.</p><p>The products developed include the Predictive Interactive Groundstation Interface software package or PIGI (pronounced “piggy”). The software uses real-time data to map the entire solar system, including every planet, satellite and other object floating around up there.</p><p>They also created a space tether – ostensibly a yo-yo that conducts electricity – which can be used to rid the Earth’s atmosphere of the thousands of pieces of orbiting space junk.</p><p>And then there’s his space beer, which Held says is the first beer which can be consumed safely in space.</p><p>But more on that here, here and here.</p><p>Held was raised in Maryland, in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US, and says he always wanted to be a spaceman like his heroes in the Star Wars films.  </p><p>“When was young I wanted to be a Jedi - Luke Skywalker - but as an adult it’s Mace Windu. I always wanted to work in the space industry, but I had very poor grades at school. I was a bad undergrad.”</p><p>Despite this, he managed to get into the Virginia Military Institute, entering as an artillery officer. After five years of study Held was called up to serve in Bosnia, Germany and Korea when his life changed.</p><p>“I was on leave in Korea and on a whim took a flying lesson,” he says. “The guy who gave me the lesson was a Blackhawk helicopter pilot. He showed me how to take off, turn, and land and then said: ‘Now you try it.’”</p><p>After being thrown into the deep end, Held says the flight brought back his passion for space. At 26 he went to his battalion commander and told him he wanted a change of direction.</p><p>“My first space job was working on the International Space Station doing test design,” he says.</p><p>“I then worked on the Hubble telescope for a while doing flight software. Then September 11 happened and I got pulled out of my job, back into the army. But this time they sent me to space command which is where I wanted to be in the first place.”</p><p>Held became a senior instructor at the US Military Space School but when he decided to do an advanced degree he chose to move to Australia. He eventually completed his PhD at the University of Sydney and founded Saber in 2007.</p><p>“I'd like to see Saber working on technologies of benefit to people working in space and other harsh environments,” he says today.</p><p>“Our operations software should be controlling space stations, planning logistics, and reducing space mission waste in general.”</p><p>Held says his PIGI software could have averted something like the Challenger space shuttle disaster by giving the craft an autonomous abort capability.</p><p>He says the same technology could also be useful to predict the best time to replace critical parts and so reduce the cost of living in space for something like a Mars base project.</p><p>Almost everyone who enters Saber Astronautics does so as an intern. While some will become full-time staff, others have gone on to launch their own start-ups, with mission operations supported by the company.</p><p>Saber interns Solange “Marstrolozenge” Cunin and Sebastian Choi (who has yet to earn his own “space name”) have launched their own start-up Quberider, a satellite ridesharing business.</p><p>Quberider aims to reduce the financial, technical and time barriers to entering the space industry by developing cheap and easy satellite platforms, Cunin says.  </p><p>“‘Riders’ share the space on board to reduce the cost for everyone,” he says.</p><p>The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is their first customer and Saber’s Jason Held says successes like this are proof you don’t need Silicon Valley to move space mountains.</p><p>“It surprised me how most Australians secretly want a space industry but do not realise it’s possible,” Held says. “Students are told by their professors, by their government, etc that what Saber does every day should be done elsewhere.</p><p>“The most surprising thing, however, is that people don’t think <em>they</em> are capable. ‘It’s not rocket science’ is a misnomer, and increasingly people are seeing that it's not as hard as it used to be.”</p>",

      "body": "<p>Lillyman says he does his most innovative thinking during mundane early morning tasks such as shaving or ironing his shirt. By the time the iron is hot, he has already checked in with Virgin’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) and pressing business momentarily gives flight to ‘What if?’ solutions to problems posed.</p><p>By 8.30am, when he pulls into the carpark at Virgin Village, the airline’s operational hub, Lillyman is ready for anything a day in aviation may throw at him. In the coming hours, he’ll check in with his five direct reports, managers who in turn coordinate the activities of specialists in the OCC including customer-disruption services, flight-planning services and meteorology. They then work closely with teams looking after crew scheduling and welfare, premium guest services and social media. </p><p>Lillyman is the master of relevant conversation as he traverses the pathways between buildings at the Village. There’s little chit-chat, but there are no bumpy takeoffs, just a smooth ascent into discussions at the top line of each person’s current concerns and projects.</p><p>Innovation in Lillyman’s role is in designing efficient organisational flows that bring out the best in people: systems that integrate, say, the data feed from sensors reporting on the health and performance of a GE jet engine into the flow of maintenance work that then guarantees fast turnaround of safety-checked aircraft at the airport gates.</p><p>Technology for Lillyman is a vital means to enable his team to effectively communicate crucial information. Digital access to real-time monitoring systems in the multi-screen OCC is one thing, but having knowledgeable, adaptable people in the same room with data at their fingertips, he says, is the way to quickly solve problems and manage ever-changing variables. “There’s not one computerised system that joins all the dots,” he says. “But it’s people who can use the systems collaboratively.”</p><p>Although he can monitor and respond to every aspect of Virgin’s network from the OCC, Lillyman still sometimes drives the 20 minutes to Brisbane airport. At tarmac’s edge, he’s conversant with the airport manager’s concerns, and appreciates the perspective of engineers in the maintenance hangar.</p><p>Lillyman’s rapport with people at Virgin is based on his understanding of their roles and goals, and in his deeply-held desire to see everyone among his team and colleagues win. Yes win.</p><p>When asked what the young Gold Coast schoolboy Andrew wanted to be when he grew up, Lillyman doesn’t duck, “Oh, I think like all children what I wanted to do was play cricket for Australia. I’m still working on my cricket skills with my son, but I think yeah, it’s the team spirit  that I like and probably competitive spirit as well. I bring a little bit of that to work each day.”</p><p>He credits his mother with modelling the ability to have a conversation with anyone, and with developing his empathy. He says: “She was very outgoing, more outgoing than I am, and I learned from that.”</p><p>A facility for solving numbers-based problems led Lillyman to study accountancy at school, Commerce at the University of Queensland, and then to earn a back-up degree — a “Plan B” — in Economics. But he was already working in insolvency by the time he finished his studies.</p><p>As a chartered accountant working in administration of corporate and personal insolvencies, he managed investigations into the failure of businesses involved in manufacturing, construction, tourism and aviation. “My last job as a chartered accountant in corporate recovery was with Ansett and its administration,” he recalls. “At that time I was looking to do something more positive — something more about growing things, rather than winding-up companies.” </p><p>In 2002, Lillyman was offered a position establishing an aircraft maintenance team for what was then Virgin Blue. “That was managing a business where I was employee number one, but which became 150 engineers,” he says.</p><p>“I don’t come from a classic airline background, but I guess having a mind that is curious for improvement, I think that’s what’s important.”</p><p>Hooked on managing multifaceted operations, Lillyman was tipped for other challenges at Virgin, such as running Virgin Blue’s airport operations, and subsequently merging the airline’s domestic and international reservation systems. </p><p>Under Lillyman’s direction, the Unify Program streamlined the airline’s unwieldy ticketing and travel-coding system, enabling guests to travel without re-ticketing and rechecking baggage on flights involving transfers between Virgin’s domestic, international and partnered flights with airlines such as Etihad and Delta. Unify also boosted sales to travel management companies such as Amex and Carlson Wagonlit. </p><p>Unify included training of more than 3,000 staff across 10 countries in new procedures. “It was quite a complex program of work,” says Lillyman in a little salted nutshell of understatement.</p>",

      "body": "<p>“It’s one of my passions to set up one of the best possible datasets and maximise the use of this research vessel,” Martin says, explaining the part of her job that involves not just helping with the collection of data, but making sure it’s ordered and assembled correctly — in addition to making sure that the data-gathering equipment is correctly calibrated and working perfectly. “Investigator is Australia’s only blue-water, multi-disciplinary research vessel, and we have to use this resource really well.”</p><p>Since the Investigator set out on its maiden voyage from its home port of Hobart, Tasmania, in March 2015, Martin has been integral to the team testing the ship’s equipment in a series of trial voyages. She’ll continue to devote about 40 per cent of her working year to supporting the hi-tech vessel, which is managed by the CSIRO’s Marine National Facility (MNF) for use by atmospheric, oceanographic, biological and geoscience scientists.</p><p>Although she’ll spend more time in her CSIRO office, located next to Investigator’s berth and looking across to Hobart’s famed Constitution Dock,  Martin will continue to join deep-sea research voyages, which can last up to 60 days.</p><p>You wouldn’t be able to tie her down if you tried. </p><p>“I grew up travelling the east coast of Australia,” she explains. “When I was five, my parents decided they wanted to explore, so they bundled the family into a caravan and we’d move every 12 or 18 months, going somewhere new. We spent a lot of time outside, got interested in the natural environment. And it took me a long time to get around to it, but I’m sure that’s where some of my early interest in science came from.”</p><p>She started out working at a kitchen counter rather than a lab bench. “After high school I did biology and marine biology, but not maths, physics or chemistry,” Martin says. She began a chef’s apprenticeship in a Mediterranean restaurant, and later spent time cooking traditional Mexican food. “I spent nine years as a chef … travelled ... it was a great life. But I definitely wanted different challenges as I got older,” she recalls.</p><p>Martin began a biology degree, but that turned out to be another fascinating side trip.</p><p>“I was about two-thirds of the way through the biology degree when I started to take on a couple of geology and astronomy subjects and got really excited,” she says. “I decided that was the path for me, and started all over again doing geophysics.”</p><p>Degrees from the University of Queensland, Macquarie University and a PhD at the University of Sydney (The Tectonic Reactivation and Paleo Stress of the North West Shelf of Australia) led her to her first job, working with geochemists. </p><p>Says Martin: “We were using earthquake seismology and thermodynamics to link that to geochemistry that the geochemists were doing with tiny little semiprecious minerals that are brought up from the mantle by lava and magma tubes ... they could date those very precisely through radio isotopic aging. We were trying to come up with what’s called tectonothermal age of the lithosphere … a broad idea of how old the lower crust and upper mantle is compared to the rest of the Earth... And we came up with some great surprises there. We learned that the age of the lithosphere underneath isn’t always related to the age of the crust above, for example. That was a really fascinating project.”</p><p>Next, Martin set sail for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), where she worked as a marine geophysicist and began using bathymetry to study “the glacial retreat on the Antarctic continental shelf coming out of the last ice age”. She spent five happy years at BAS, where she also met her British husband. “It’s a great lifestyle. I’d been working in Antarctica for 12 years by the time I finished there, because a lot of the work I did in Australia was Antarctic-focused as well.”</p><p>At BAS, Martin uncovered yet another deep personal passion. “I started to develop very strong opinions on how science data management should be developed ... for stronger science,” she explains. “Particularly in a place like Antarctica where you get a lot of different countries acquiring data in the same place ... unless people start to talk to each other and share data, you start to lose data. And science has such limited resources, we really need to be working together and focusing on acquiring data that everyone can use.”</p><p>She walked the talk. “I moved from being a pure researcher to geophysics data manager for the British Antarctic Survey, trying to safeguard all of the historic data, safely manage all of the existing and acquired data, and also liaising with other people in other countries and getting together those big collated datasets, which as we move forward into the new data age are going to drive a lot of fundamental science.”</p><p>Martin had no intention of leaving BAS when, late in 2010, the opportunity came to join CSIRO in Hobart and be part of the team that would support the Investigator: “To get involved with a new research vessel, to be able to build a resource to feed back into the Australian scientific community, and make it as good as I possibly can, that’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and that’s a chance I couldn’t turn down.”</p>",

      "body": "<p>Calimmune’s main breakthrough, explains Symonds, is in using a genetic mechanism to inhibit binding of the HIV virus, whereas currently used drugs—chemicals or biologics that must be taken daily—act to inhibit the virus at various points in its life cycle.</p><p>“What we’re doing at Calimmune is adding genes that will inhibit replication of the virus into a number of an individual’s extracted cells,” he says. “The modification is like an armour that protects the cells from HIV. We grow that population of shielded cells outside the body, and return them to the person. The expectation is that as the infected cells are eventually killed off by HIV, the protected population of cells takes over.”</p><p>Symonds recently stepped out of the role of chief scientific officer for Calimmune, in which he coordinated research and development, and into that of head of scientific affairs and collaborations. The move, he says, was necessary, in that it enables him to “look forward, to where Calimmune is going to roll out this treatment”. </p><p>While his clinical team is focused on completing rigorous trials of the therapy, Symonds’ job is now, “to ensure that we have the appropriate techniques and collaborations in place to be able to handle a large number of patients”.</p><p>Symonds is master of the concise answer, naturally simplifying explanations of the complex web of tasks and group dynamics under his management—and no wonder!</p><p>Consider that Calimmune’s research group in Australia is mirrored in its structure and program of work by its counterpart in Los Angeles. The company overall also works collaboratively with several other researchers, such as a group within the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) that has developed animal models, mice, that accept human cells—essential to the safety testing of gene therapies. In the US, Symonds also coordinates collaborations with investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle and the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>Another series of collaborations links Calimmune to various disciplines at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), where Symonds holds an adjunct professorship and co-supervises a PhD Student, Scott Ledger, in <em>his</em> work with HIV, which contributes to Calimmune’s expertise. Ledger’s other supervisor is John Murray, professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, who also applies his innovative mathematical modelling to Calimmune’s work. </p><p>In addition, Calimmune uses a clean room laboratory at the Kids Research Institute at Westmead Children’s Hospital, and its light-filled offices and main lab in Darlinghurst are supported by St Vincent’s Centre for Applied Medical Research. </p><p>This is only a portion of what Symonds keeps a handle on, and drives forward with the help of a small but focused staff, Skype, email, Post-It notes and a well-used mobile phone.</p><p>“It’s a bit like moving sands: how do you keep all of this advancing in a progression that will eventually get to a conclusion point, and make sure that things don’t get forgotten or lost along the way?” he says. </p><p>When the task seems overwhelming he tells himself: “We’re going to get there in the end.” </p><p>Back near the beginning, Symonds was a boy at Maroubra Junction Primary School “trying to understand how animals got about and did things”. He says that “the notion of discovery of basic principles as they applied to living organisms” led him to a degree in Science at Sydney University, a PhD in Cell Biology and Genetics at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, and more post-doctoral work on genes and cells at the University of California, San Francisco. </p><p>His subsequent work has been in cancer and HIV research, including several years with Johnson &amp; Johnson, until he joined Calimmune in 2009.</p><p>A typical day in the life of Symonds involves any number of meetings starting at 6am with a Skype or phone call to Jeff Bartlett, Calimmune’s senior vice president of research and development, who’s on LA time. Based on that discussion, Symonds says he might reassign priorities among his group, depending on the most urgent tasks. </p><p>Symonds takes several thought-processing breaks during the day, sometimes walking to his local Darlinghurst cafe, The Bunker, or driving to meet colleagues at UNSW.</p><p>He keeps fit cycling each week in Centennial Park and takes regular Pilates classes, to maintain stamina for days that often run until 10pm as he reads new scientific papers that might advance the greater campaign to benefit patients.</p><p>“If you have HIV at the moment you can live a reasonable life taking drugs every day,” he says. But only some 10% of the more than 34 million people currently living with HIV are properly controlling the disease with drugs — at a cost of around $20 billion annually. And the drugs can have severe side effects. </p><p>“Also, taking the drugs reminds you that you’re sick. Our treatment might be a one-time or infrequent treatment, which would allay the need to take drugs all the time.” Freedom? “Yes, freedom,” says Symonds.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Rolling stock, for those not au fait with the fine art of trainspotting, is pretty much every vehicle that travels on a railway track, from locomotives to the cars they pull, to the various maintenance and provisioning cars needed to support a rail operation of any size. As manager of rolling stock maintenance for Western Australia’s brand new iron-ore mine Roy Hill, Brymer has found the perfect job — 33 years after he joined Queensland Rail (QR) as a teenaged apprentice fitter and turner. “I never really dreamed of being in the railway,” muses Brymer. “But once you get in it… I enjoy understanding the history of rail and how it’s all come together, and mates of mine joke around that I’m a ‘gunzel’, but I’m not. I’m an enthusiast!”</p><p>Brymer is indeed a passionate, precise rolling-stock analyst and practitioner, so you definitely can’t shunt him into the trainspotting siding occupied by railway “gunzels”. Nevertheless, he points out that his “railway blood runs deep … I grew up in Rockhampton — a big railway town in Queensland — you were never far from the railway,” he says. “My great-grandfather was a ganger, my grandfather was a carpenter and my father was a carpenter’s labourer.”</p><p>When Brymer joined his fellow QR apprentices, there were 64 in that year’s intake, and a total of around 250 trainees in a workshop staff of 1,200. Today, he says ruefully: “I think they hire four or five in a good year.” As a result, trained specialist maintenance staff such as Brymer, and the drivers who drive the locomotives they service, are in short supply and hot demand, as is evidenced by the many English, Irish and Kiwi accents you’ll find around the tracks and rail yards of mining towns. </p><p>After finishing his tradesman’s certificate, Brymer did an engineering degree part time at Queensland Central University, and ended up managing the maintenance for QR’s wagon fleet. “The Roy Hill job was an ideal opportunity to take everything that I’d learned over almost 30 years of working for Queensland Rail, and put it into practice in a greenfield situation,” says Brymer. “The locomotives came with all the features that we wanted to put on our locomotives.”</p><p>After three years of managing his part of the operation from Perth, and as Roy Hill gears up for its FOOS (“first ore on ship”) day in September, Brymer and wife Jacqui are moving to Port Hedland and into one of Roy Hill's Cyclone Category 5-rated brand new homes, each with its own pool. The houses have been built for Brymer and his fellow managers, who will be the permanent fixtures running the armies of mining-camp-domiciled FIFO workers — they’re among the thousands of tightly synchronised cogs that make up a mining operation. </p><p>Fourteen massive <a href=\"http://gereports.com.au/post/25-03-2015/roy-hill-s-new-ge-locomotives-are-super-strong-and-super-smart\"><u>GE Evolution ES44ACi heavy-haul locomotives</u></a> are at the heart of the operation (in the future, there will be 21 of them), and on top of being specially equipped with souped-up cooling systems to enable them to withstand the Pilbara’s blistering heat, they have onboard the latest Industrial Internet technology. </p><p>Brymer talks through the locomotives’ features — many involving sensors and remote-control operations — with boy-with-a-new-train-set enthusiasm. At the same time, it’s clear that he’s one maintenance manager who will always combine new technology with old-school hands-on attention to his fleet. “There’re plenty of things that you can observe in a train when it’s out on the track,” he explains. “You can hear the wheels, whether or not they’ve got defects. You can hear the bearings, if they’ve got defects. You can hear wheels squeal if the bogies aren’t tracking correctly. And then if you look at the rail on the track, you can see how the wheels are passing over the rails, and get a sense of how the rolling stock is performing on the track, whether or not it’s tracking well or tracking skewed … are there any problems with the track or the rolling stock that you need to attend to. Sometimes you feel the track for how rough it is; roughness can tell you that you’ve got a problem with the gauge-face lubrication, or bogie rotational resistance. It just helps you understand how the railway’s actually performing.”</p><p>And away from the job, Brymer says Port Hedland will be a new adventure for him and wife Jacqui: “There’s so much of Australia to explore up here. Karajini National Park, Broome, Karatha and Port Hedland itself … the fishing up here is apparently the best <em>ever</em>. Jacqui and I will flip our exercise habits from the afternoon to the morning, which we used to do in Rockhampton. We'll be up at five, go for a walk, go to work, do our thing, come home and relax. We’re looking forward to getting here.” And it will just be the two of them — they married young, and their four kids are all out of home.</p><p>Brymer jokes that those kids would moan when they’d notice him slowing down as the family car approached a level crossing, hoping to be stopped so he could watch and listen, but he must be right about the railway blood running deep: daughter Kelsey is an accountant with rail-freight giant Aurizon. A fifth-generation Brymer is now in the railways business.</p>",
